1. 
We can go to the source section of the browser's developer tool and search all file for the flag.

2. 
We can download all the files of a webpage with wget. That is we can mirror the whole webpage
we do this by:
	wget -m url
	
then we can just use grep to find the flag

command:
	grep -RoE "picoCTF{.*?}" | cut -d ":" -f3
	
the cut function will cut the output string according to the "d"delimiter and we wil print out the 
3rd field.

flag:
	picoCTF{1nsp3ti0n_0f_w3bpag3s_8de925a7}
